# <h1 align="center" id="heading">PEN-300 / OSEP Code Dump 2022</h1>

A collection of tools I wrote or improved upon while studying for the OSEP exam. Most of the code in this repository is either a direct copy or near direct copy (with improvements or modifications) from the examples provided in the Offensive Security PEN-300 course material. The techniques outlined are heavily signatured by most (if not all) modern antivirius solutions. The code included in this repository should only be used as a starting point for better (more stealthy) code. The code examples provided are for EDUCATIONAL PURPOUSES ONLY and should be used in a lab environment.

## Getting Started

All of the C# projects were written, compiled, and tested using .NET version 4.7.2 in Visual Studio 2019. The other languages (C in particular) have the compiling instructions embedded as comments within the code. This project is a work in progress and will be updated on a regular basis.
